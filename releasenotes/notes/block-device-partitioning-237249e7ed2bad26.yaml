features:
  - Create partitions with MBR layout optimized for performance and
    highly configurable.

deprecations:
  - The new partitions are created based on configuration rather than
    on a list of provided commands for a special partitioning tool.
    Therefore elements using tools (like partitioning-sfdisk) are
    deprecated and will be removed.
