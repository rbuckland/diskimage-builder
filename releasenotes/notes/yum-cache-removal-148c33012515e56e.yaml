deprecations:
  - The ``DIB_YUMCHROOT_USE_CACHE`` variable has been removed and the
    Fedora and CentOS ``-minimal`` initial chroot will always be
    created by the package manager.  The default creation of a chroot
    tarball is stopped for these elements.  This unused option was
    unsafe; there is no guarantee that the base system will not change
    even between runs.  Getting the package manager to reuse the cache
    for the initial chroot install is future work.
