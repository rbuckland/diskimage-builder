    dib no longer exports ``dib-run-parts``.  Adding this was an
    oversight made during v2 development, since ``dib-utils`` already
    provides this.  The ``dib-run-parts`` used internally
    (``diskimage_builder/lib/dib-run-parts``) is not intended to be
    used by external tools.  If you require ``dib-run-parts``, you
    should install the ``dib-utils`` package.
